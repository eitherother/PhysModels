Physical Models in Pure Data

The repository contains introductory physical models based on the Synthesis Toolkit
I put together for teaching demonstrations in intermediate PD programming, physical
modeling, and intro signal processing (especially filters). The folder includes a 
plucked string, clarinet, and vibraphone. There is also a demo for a comb filter 
in conjuction with the plucked string. A related resource is: 
Cook, Perry. Real Sound Synthesis for Interactive Applications. Natick, MA: A K Peters, 2002.
